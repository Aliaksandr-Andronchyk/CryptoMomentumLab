"""The two rotation engines.

Both share the same signal: an alt earns a slot when its annualized momentum
beats the base asset's by more than `entry_edge` (and is positive in its own
right), and keeps the slot until that edge drops below `exit_edge` or turns
negative. They differ only in how they size and maintain positions — see
`Sizing` in `config.py`.
